Duration-4 Weeks 

Mentor- Neela Santosh

Description- focuses on understanding and implementing API integration in a web application. The main objective of this task is to develop a responsive webpage that can fetch data from a public API (such as weather, news, or any open data source) and display that data dynamically to users. This task helps in learning how real-world web applications communicate with external services to retrieve and present live data.
In this task, the developer starts by creating a basic webpage using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality. The webpage layout should be responsive, meaning it should work properly on different screen sizes such as desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. Responsiveness ensures a better user experience and is an important requirement in modern web development.
The core part of this task is working with a public API. An API (Application Programming Interface) allows applications to communicate with each other. In this task, the webpage sends a request to a public API using JavaScript methods such as fetch() or axios. The API then responds with data, usually in JSON format. This data can include information like temperature and weather conditions, latest news headlines, or any other publicly available data.
Once the data is received from the API, JavaScript is used to process and display the data dynamically on the webpage. This means the content on the page updates automatically without reloading the page. For example, when the page loads or when a user clicks a button, the webpage fetches fresh data from the API and shows it instantly. This demonstrates how dynamic web applications work in real time.
Error handling is also an important part of this task. The application should be able to handle situations such as network errors, invalid API responses, or missing data. Simple error messages can be displayed to inform the user if something goes wrong. This improves reliability and usability of the application.
Through this task, the developer gains practical experience in API integration, asynchronous JavaScript, and DOM manipulation. It also improves understanding of how frontend applications interact with external services. Completing this task successfully shows the ability to build a functional web application that uses real-time data, which is a valuable skill in full-stack and frontend development.
Overall, Task-1 is designed to build a strong foundation in web development by combining UI design, API usage, and dynamic data handling. It prepares the intern to work on more advanced projects involving real-world data and complex web applications.
